The school documented the reason, asked the student to submit a written request upon return, and approved the LOA starting on the first day the student will be absent.\"",
    "response": "This LOA request handling is compliant with Policy IV.06 for unforeseen circumstances. Items 5a-c specifically allow institutions to grant LOAs without prior written requests when unforeseen circumstances prevent advance requests if: (a) the institution documents its decision reason (which was done), (b) collects the request later (plan to collect upon return), and (c) establishes the start date as the first absent day (which was done). The school correctly followed the unforeseen circumstances exception procedure outlined in the policy."

    "response": "Violation flagged: This policy violates Item 9 of Policy IV.06, which requires that \"the student's contract period will be extended by the same number of calendar days taken in the LOA.\" The policy incorrectly states contracts will be \"placed on hold\" rather than extended. Additionally, the policy fails to specify that changes to the enrollment agreement must either be initialed by all parties (9a) or documented through a signed addendum (9b). These are critical compliance issues that could affect student contract rights and institutional obligations."

    "instruction": "Explain why this scenario violates Policy IV.06: \"A student has taken two previous LOAs totaling 160 days in the past 10 months. The student is now requesting a 30-day LOA for medical reasons with proper documentation. The school approved the request.\"",
    "response": "This scenario violates Item 7 of Policy IV.06, which states that a \"student will not be granted a LOA if the LOA, together with any additional LOAs previously granted, exceed a total of 180 calendar days in any 12-month period.\" The student has already used 160 days of LOA in the past 10 months, which falls within the 12-month period. Adding a 30-day LOA would bring the total to 190 days, exceeding the maximum 180 days allowed. The school should have denied this request or limited it to 20 days to remain compliant with the policy's maximum allowable LOA period."

  {
    "instruction": "Rate this LOA documentation practice: \"When students request LOAs, they complete a form stating their reason and signing it. For unexpected absences, students call the school, and upon return, they complete the LOA form with the actual first date of absence. The form includes signature lines for both the student and administrator.\"",
    "response": "This LOA documentation practice is fully compliant with Policy IV.06. It satisfies Items 4a-c by requiring written requests with reason and signature for planned LOAs. It also properly implements Items 5a-c for unforeseen circumstances by allowing students to call first and complete documentation upon return, using the first absence date as the LOA start date. The inclusion of signature lines for both parties supports compliance with Item 9b regarding proper documentation of contract changes, though the practice should explicitly address contract extensions to be fully compliant."

    "instruction": "Check this contract extension process for compliance: \"For students on approved LOAs, the school extends the contract end date by adding weekdays of the LOA period. The new date is calculated by the administrator and communicated verbally to the student upon return.\"",
    "response": "This contract extension process is non-compliant with Policy IV.06. While it attempts to address Item 9 regarding contract extensions, it has multiple violations: (1) It only adds weekdays rather than \"the same number of calendar days taken in the LOA\" as required, (2) It fails to document the change through either initials on the enrollment agreement (9a) or a signed addendum (9b), and (3) Verbal communication of the new date is insufficient documentation. Additionally, there's no indication this process ensures the revised end date doesn't exceed the 15-day limitation noted in footnote 8."

    "instruction": "Evaluate this scenario's compliance with Policy IV.06: \"A student began an approved 30-day LOA but did not return on the scheduled return date. After 10 additional days with no contact, the school processed a withdrawal calculating refunds based on the student's last day of attendance before the LOA began.\"",
    "response": "This scenario is non-compliant with Policy IV.06. According to Item 10a, at an institution required to take attendance, \"the student's withdrawal date for the purpose of calculating a refund will be the student's last date of attendance.\" The school incorrectly used the date before the LOA began rather than the last date of actual attendance. If this is an attendance-taking institution, the correct withdrawal date would be the last date the student actually attended before failing to return from the LOA. Using an incorrect date affects refund calculations and potentially violates both NACCAS requirements and federal financial aid regulations."

It correctly addresses Item 9, which requires that \"the student's contract period will be extended by the same number of calendar days taken in the LOA.\" It also properly implements Item 9b by specifying that contract changes will be documented through \"an addendum signed by all parties.\" This approach ensures proper documentation of the contract extensions and protects both the student and institution by maintaining clear records of the agreement modifications resulting from the LOA."

If approved, the registrar notifies financial aid and adjusts the student's expected graduation date in the system. Students are not charged additional tuition for time on approved LOA.\"",
    "response": "This LOA request process is partially compliant but violates several aspects of Policy IV.06. While it properly addresses Item 6 (no additional charges) and attempts to handle Item 9 (contract extensions), it violates Item 4a which requires the request to be \"in writing\" - an email may qualify, but it must include the student's signature (physical or electronic), which isn't mentioned. Additionally, there's no documentation of contract extensions being initialed or signed by all parties as required by Items 9a or 9b. Finally, there's no mention of procedures for unforeseen circumstances as required by Items 5a-c."

    "instruction": "Flag violations in this institution's practice: \"The school grants LOAs for medical reasons only. Students must provide a doctor's note with their written request. The school grants a maximum of 180 days of LOA per enrollment period regardless of the timeframe.\"",
    "response": "Violation flagged: This practice violates Item 7 of Policy IV.06, which limits LOAs to \"a total of 180 calendar days in any 12-month period.\" The institution incorrectly applies the 180-day limit \"per enrollment period regardless of timeframe\" rather than per 12-month period as required. This could result in students receiving excessive LOA time within a 12-month period if their enrollment spans multiple years. Additionally, limiting LOAs to medical reasons only may be overly restrictive compared to the policy's intent, though the policy does allow institutions to define acceptable reasons."

    "response": "This LOA approval documentation is compliant with Policy IV.06. It properly implements Items 5a-c regarding LOAs for unforeseen circumstances by: (a) documenting the reason for the decision to approve the LOA despite lack of advance request, (b) noting the plan to collect the written request when the student returns, and (c) implicitly establishing the start date based on the emergency situation. The documentation in the student's file with the director's signature provides an appropriate audit trail demonstrating adherence to the policy requirements for emergency situations."

  {
    "instruction": "Explain why this situation is non-compliant: \"A student submitted a properly documented LOA request for 45 days. Upon approval, the school added a $50 administrative fee to the student's account for processing the leave of absence paperwork.\"",
    "response": "This situation violates Item 6 of Policy IV.06, which explicitly states that \"a student will not be assessed any additional charges as a result of a requested LOA.\" By charging a $50 administrative fee specifically for processing the LOA paperwork, the school is directly violating this prohibition. This requirement ensures that students aren't financially penalized for taking an approved leave, regardless of the administrative work involved in processing the request. The fee must be removed to bring this situation into compliance with Policy IV.06."

  {
    "instruction": "Check if this withdrawal calculation meets policy requirements: \"A student on an approved LOA notified the school they would not return. The school, which is not required to take attendance, calculated the withdrawal date as the day the student notified the school of their decision not to return.\"",
    "response": "This withdrawal calculation is non-compliant with Policy IV.06. According to Item 10b, at an institution not required to take attendance, \"the student's withdrawal date for the purpose of calculating a refund will be the date the student began the LOA.\" Since this institution is not required to take attendance, it should have used the date the student began the LOA as the withdrawal date, not the date of notification. Using an incorrect withdrawal date affects refund calculations and could result in inaccurate charges to the student or incorrect returns of Title IV funds."

    "instruction": "Rate this LOA policy element: \"The institution's policy states: 'If a student does not return from an approved leave of absence on the scheduled return date, the student will be withdrawn from the program. For refund calculation purposes, the withdrawal date will be the student's last day of attendance at the institution.'\"",
    "response": "This LOA policy element is partially compliant with Policy IV.06. It correctly addresses the withdrawal process for students who don't return from LOA, but its compliance with Item 10 depends on whether the institution is required to take attendance. If the institution is required to take attendance, then using \"the student's last day of attendance\" as the withdrawal date is correct (Item 10a). However, if the institution is not required to take attendance, the policy should specify that the withdrawal date is \"the date the student began the LOA\" (Item 10b). The policy needs to clarify which type of institution it is to be fully compliant."

    "instruction": "Evaluate this contract extension calculation: \"A student began a 45-day LOA on March 1, 2025, with original contract end date of June 15, 2025. The school extended the contract to August 1, 2025, which is 47 days beyond the original date (including weekend days).\"",
    "response": "This contract extension calculation is compliant with Policy IV.06. Item 9 requires that \"the student's contract period will be extended by the same number of calendar days taken in the LOA.\" The LOA was 45 days, and the extension added 47 days, which includes all calendar days as required. While the extension is slightly longer than the LOA period (by 2 days), this falls within acceptable parameters as the policy requires at minimum the same number of days. Footnote 8 only restricts extensions from exceeding 15 days past the correctly calculated revised end date, which this does not do."

    "response": "This policy identification is non-compliant with Policy IV.06. Item 1 specifically requires that the institution's policy \"Is written and identified as a Leave of Absence Policy.\" Using alternative terminology like \"Extended Absence Protocol\" fails to properly identify the document as a Leave of Absence Policy. This identification is important for regulatory compliance, student understanding, and proper implementation of federal financial aid rules that specifically reference \"Leave of Absence\" policies. The document should be clearly labeled as a \"Leave of Absence Policy\" to meet the requirements."

For emergency situations, students must contact the school within 24 hours. If they fail to do so, the school does not approve retroactive LOAs under any circumstances.\"",
    "response": "Violation flagged: This practice violates Items 5a-c of Policy IV.06 regarding unforeseen circumstances. The policy allows institutions to grant LOAs to students who could not provide prior notice due to unforeseen circumstances, with no specified time limit for notification. The school's rigid requirement that students contact within 24 hours and blanket refusal to approve \"retroactive LOAs\" contradicts the policy's allowance for flexibility in genuine unforeseen circumstances. The institution should modify its practice to allow for proper documentation of the reason for its decision, later collection of the request, and establishment of the correct start date, regardless of when notification occurs."

    "response": "This enrollment agreement addendum is compliant with Policy IV.06. It properly implements Item 9 by extending the contract by the same number of calendar days as the LOA (46 days), and it documents this through \"an addendum to the enrollment agreement... signed by all parties\" as required by Item 9b. The original end date was 8/15/25, and the new end date of 9/30/25 represents an extension of 46 days, matching the LOA duration.

It correctly addresses Item 10a for institutions required to take attendance, where \"the student's withdrawal date for the purpose of calculating a refund will be the student's last date of attendance.\" However, it fails to address Item 10b for institutions not required to take attendance, where the withdrawal date should be \"the date the student began the LOA.\" The statement needs to differentiate between attendance-taking and non-attendance-taking institutions to be fully compliant, as the withdrawal date determination method differs based on this classification."

The administrator approved the LOA based on the student's clear explanation and attached supporting documentation, noting in the file that the signature would be obtained when the student returns.\"",
    "response": "This LOA approval process is non-compliant with Policy IV.06. For standard (non-emergency) LOA requests, Item 4c requires that \"the request must include the student's signature.\" Unlike unforeseen circumstances covered in Item 5, there is no provision for collecting a signature later for planned LOAs. The administrator should have returned the form for signature before approval or determined if this qualified as an unforeseen circumstance under Item 5. If it was a planned LOA with advance notice, approving it without a signature violates the policy requirements, regardless of the quality of the explanation or supporting documentation."
