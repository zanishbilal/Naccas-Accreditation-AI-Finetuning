    "instruction": "Review this document for compliance with Policy IV.05: \"Beauty Academy plans to close on June 30, 2025, and will submit a Teach-Out Plan on June 15, 2025. The plan includes a list of students and a statement acknowledging financial obligations to aid providers.\"",
    "response": "This document is non-compliant with Policy IV.05. According to Section C, for planned closures, the Teach-Out Plan must be submitted 30 days prior to the closure date (not 15 days as indicated). Additionally, while the plan includes student lists and financial obligation acknowledgments, it fails to address several required elements from the Teach-Out Plan Checklist, such as providing the \"How to Locate an Accredited Institution\" document to students and identifying a custodian of records."

  {
    "instruction": "Assess whether this institution meets the requirements to serve as a Teach-Out institution: \"Cosmetology Institute is located 30 miles from the closing school, is currently under investigation by the state regulatory agency for potential misrepresentation in advertising, but offers identical programs and has the capacity to accept all students.\"",
    "response": "This institution does not meet the requirements to serve as a Teach-Out institution under Policy IV.05. According to Checklist Item 8(b), a Teach-Out institution must not \"be under investigation for, be subject to an action concerning, or being prosecuted for an issue related to academic quality, misrepresentation, fraud, or other severe matters by a law enforcement agency.\" Since Cosmetology Institute is under investigation for misrepresentation, it fails this requirement regardless of its program offerings or capacity."

  {
    "instruction": "Check this Teach-Out Plan for compliance: \"The plan acknowledges the institution will provide pro rata refunds to all students but does not include a Teach-Out Agreement despite having three accredited schools within a 25-mile radius.\"",
    "response": "This Teach-Out Plan is non-compliant with Policy IV.05. While the institution may elect to provide pro rata refunds, footnote 6 specifically states that \"giving pro rata refunds to all students is not a substitute for the required submission of a Teach-Out Plan (and Teach-Out Agreement, if practicable).\" Since there are three accredited schools within a 25-mile radius, a Teach-Out Agreement is considered practicable according to the policy definition, and therefore must be included."
  },
  {
    "instruction": "Rate this institution's compliance with notification requirements: \"Following an unplanned closure on May 1, 2025, the institution submitted its Teach-Out Plan on May 10, notified NACCAS, posted closure information on its website but not on social media, and provided students with a list of nearby schools.\"",
    "response": "The institution is partially compliant with Policy IV.05 notification requirements. The Teach-Out Plan was properly submitted within 15 days of the unplanned closure (May 10 is within 15 days of May 1) and they notified NACCAS as required. However, Checklist Item 1(e) requires posting information \"on its websites and all social media customarily used by the Institution,\" which was not fully done. Additionally, providing students with a list of nearby schools does not satisfy the requirement in 1(h) to provide the NACCAS \"How to Locate an Accredited Institution Within Your Field of Study\" document."
  },
  {
    "instruction": "Flag any violations in this Teach-Out Agreement: \"The agreement includes a list of enrolled students, a record retention plan, and information on credits accepted by the teach-out institution. The teach-out institution is located 75 miles from the closing institution.\"",
    "response": "Violation flagged: The Teach-Out Agreement violates Checklist Item 5, which requires that \"The Teach-Out Agreement must provide students access to the program and services without requiring them to move or travel for substantial distances or durations.\" With the teach-out institution located 75 miles away, this represents a substantial travel distance for students, making the agreement non-compliant with Policy IV.05."
  },
  {
    "instruction": "Evaluate this statement for compliance: \"Our institution will close on December 15, 2025. Since we're providing full refunds to all students, we don't need to submit a Teach-Out Plan to NACCAS.\"",
    "response": "This statement is non-compliant with Policy IV.05. According to footnote 6, \"While a Closing Institution may choose to give pro rata refunds to all students, doing so is not a substitute for the required submission of a Teach-Out Plan (and Teach-Out Agreement, if practicable).\" A Teach-Out Plan must still be submitted 30 days prior to the planned closure date (by November 15, 2025), regardless of the decision to provide refunds."

  {
    "instruction": "Analyze this Teach-Out Plan's compliance regarding record maintenance: \"Student records will be kept by our former Director of Education at their home office for 3 years, after which they will be destroyed. Contact information will be provided to NACCAS only.\"",
    "response": "This record maintenance plan is non-compliant with Policy IV.05. According to Checklist Item 1(g), the institution must \"provide to NACCAS and to all enrolled students the name and contact information of the custodian of the Institution's files and the address where those files will be kept.\" The plan only provides this information to NACCAS, not to enrolled students. Additionally, Checklist Item 1(f) requires compliance with applicable state and federal laws regarding record maintenance, which typically require longer retention periods than 3 years for educational records."

  {
    "instruction": "Explain why this situation requires a Teach-Out Agreement: \"Beauty Elite Academy is closing its main campus but will continue operations at its branch campus 5 miles away. All students will be transferred to the branch location.\"",
    "response": "This situation requires a Teach-Out Agreement because it constitutes a \"Closure\" under Policy IV.05. According to the Definitions section, \"A 'Closure' includes any change of location considered by the U.S. Department of Education to be a closure of the existing Institution.\" Even though the branch campus is only 5 miles away, the closure of the main campus triggers the requirement for a Teach-Out Plan and Agreement since the U.S. Department of Education would consider this a closure of the existing institution, requiring proper documentation and procedures to protect students."
  },
  {
    "instruction": "Review the timeliness of this submission: \"Hairdressing Institute experienced an unplanned closure due to severe flooding on April 2, 2025. They submitted their Teach-Out Plan with executed Teach-Out Agreements on April 20, 2025.\"",
    "response": "This submission is non-compliant with Policy IV.05 timing requirements. For an unplanned closure, Section C states that \"the Teach-Out Plan (including executed copies of associated Teach-Out Agreement(s), if practicable) must be submitted no later than 15 days following the Closure date.\" The closure occurred on April 2, and the submission was made on April 20, which is 18 days after the closure—3 days beyond the required 15-day deadline—making it untimely under the policy."
  },
  {
    "instruction": "Assess this Teach-Out Plan's compliance with student notification requirements: \"The plan states that enrolled students will be notified of the closure via email, with information about the teach-out institution located 20 miles away, but does not address notification about additional charges students may incur.\"",
    "response": "This Teach-Out Plan is non-compliant with Policy IV.05 student notification requirements. Checklist Item 3(e) requires that the institution \"Must notify students of additional charges, if any\" and must explain to NACCAS how it will notify students about these charges. Additionally, Checklist Item 4(e) requires \"a clear statement to students of the tuition and fees of the educational program\" at the teach-out institution. The plan's failure to address notification about potential additional charges violates these requirements."
  },
  {
    "instruction": "Rate how well this Teach-Out Plan addresses record maintenance: \"Student records will be maintained by Records Custody Services, a third-party record management company. Student transcripts will be kept permanently, financial aid records for 7 years, and all other records for 5 years. Contact information for Records Custody Services will be provided to NACCAS and all students.\"",
    "response": "This Teach-Out Plan adequately complies with the record maintenance requirements of Policy IV.05. It addresses Checklist Item 1(f) by establishing record retention periods that likely meet state and federal requirements (permanent transcript retention, 7 years for financial aid, 5 years for other records). It also addresses Item 1(g) by identifying a custodian of records (Records Custody Services) and committing to provide this information to both NACCAS and all enrolled students as required."

  {
    "instruction": "Check if this Teach-Out institution meets requirements: \"Artistic Beauty College is willing to teach-out students from the closing institution. It is accredited, offers similar programs, has capacity for additional students, and is 10 miles from the closing institution. The institution received a warning from their state regulatory agency 2 months ago regarding inadequate instructional resources.\"",
    "response": "This Teach-Out institution does not fully meet the requirements of Policy IV.05. While it is within an acceptable distance (10 miles) and offers similar programs, Checklist Item 7(a) requires that the Teach-Out institution have \"the necessary experience, administrative capacity and capability, resources and student support services to provide an educational program that is of acceptable quality (as evidenced by state approval).\" The recent warning from the state regulatory agency regarding inadequate instructional resources raises concerns about the institution's ability to meet this requirement, particularly regarding sufficient resources for additional students."

  {
    "instruction": "Identify compliance issues in this communication to students: \"Due to closure, we've arranged for Elegant Academy to accept your credits. Their campus is 40 miles away but offers online options. Tuition is $2,000 higher than what you were paying. You'll need to contact them directly for enrollment details.\"",
    "response": "This communication has multiple compliance issues under Policy IV.05:\n1.\tIt fails to provide the NACCAS \"How to Locate an Accredited Institution\" document (Item 1h)\n2.\tIt doesn't clearly explain how additional charges will be handled (Item 3e)\n3.\tIt doesn't provide comprehensive information about credits/hours accepted (Item 4d)\n4.\tThe 40-mile distance may constitute \"substantial distance\" requiring students to travel, potentially violating Item 5\n5.\tIt lacks information about record maintenance and custody (Item 1g)\n6.\tIt lacks a plan for closed school discharge information (Item 4b)"

  {
    "instruction": "Evaluate this scenario for compliance: \"A beauty school submitted its Annual Report in February 2025 but did not include a Teach-Out Plan since it has no plans to close and is financially stable.\"",
    "response": "This scenario is non-compliant with Policy IV.05. According to Section B under \"Submission Requirements (General),\" the policy clearly states that \"With each Annual Report submission, all Institutions must submit to NACCAS a Teach-Out Plan (including a draft Teach-Out Agreement, if practicable) meeting the requirements of this Policy.\" This requirement applies to all institutions regardless of their financial stability or lack of closure plans. The beauty school's failure to include a Teach-Out Plan with its Annual Report constitutes a violation of the policy."
  },
  {
    "instruction": "Explain why this Teach-Out Agreement is deficient: \"The agreement lists the students being transferred, shows the teach-out institution's accreditation status and state license, but does not specify which credits will transfer or whether additional charges will apply.\"",
    "response": "This Teach-Out Agreement is deficient because it fails to meet several requirements specified in Checklist Item 4. Specifically, it violates Item 4(d), which requires \"Information on the number and types of credits or clock-hours the Teach-Out Institution is willing to accept prior to the student's enrollment,\" and Item 4(e), which requires \"A clear statement to students of the tuition and fees of the educational program and the number and types of credits or clock-hours that will be accepted by the Teach-Out Institution.\" The agreement also must \"clearly identify, and provide for the notification to students of, additional charges, if any.\" Without this information, students cannot make informed decisions about their education continuation."
  },
  {
    "instruction": "Review this Teach-Out Plan for compliance: \"The plan acknowledges the institution will satisfy financial obligations, maintain records according to state law, and provide students with contact information for records custodian, but does not include information about posting closure details on social media.\"",
    "response": "This Teach-Out Plan is partially compliant but violates Checklist Item 1(e) of Policy IV.05, which requires that the institution \"Must put all relevant information regarding the Closure on its websites and all social media customarily used by the Institution to communicate with students and/or the public.\" The plan addresses several requirements, including satisfaction of financial obligations (Item 1b), record maintenance (Item 1f), and providing record custodian information (Item 1g), but the failure to address social media notifications represents a compliance gap that must be remedied."
  },
  {
    "instruction": "Assess this scenario: \"After submitting a Teach-Out Plan with their Annual Report, an institution discovered that one of the three teach-out institutions listed in their plan (Prestige Beauty School) is now facing potential loss of accreditation. The institution has not updated NACCAS about this change.\"",
    "response": "This scenario presents a compliance issue with Policy IV.05. According to Checklist Item 9, \"If an institution that is party to a Teach-Out Agreement has learned that another party to the Agreement plans to close, NACCAS must be notified, in accordance with Section 4.12 of the NACCAS Rules of Practice and Procedure.\" While the policy specifically mentions closure notification, the intent includes significant changes affecting a teach-out institution's eligibility. A potential loss of accreditation would disqualify Prestige Beauty School under Item 7(a) requiring \"acceptable quality (as evidenced by state approval).\" The institution should notify NACCAS and update its Teach-Out Plan accordingly."
  },
  {
    "instruction": "Flag violations in this scenario: \"Due to immediate closure from a natural disaster, a school executed a Teach-Out Agreement with a nearby institution that is currently on probation with its accreditor but otherwise meets all requirements. The agreement includes all student information and financial details.\"",
    "response": "Violation flagged: This scenario violates Checklist Item 7(b) of Policy IV.05, which requires that the Teach-Out Institution \"Be stable and have the capacity to carry out its mission, and meet all obligations to existing students.\" An institution on probation with its accreditor cannot be considered \"stable\" as required by the policy. Additionally, depending on the nature of the probation, it may also violate Item 8(b) if the probation relates to \"academic quality, misrepresentation, fraud, or other severe matters.\" The closing institution must find another qualified teach-out partner despite the emergency circumstances."
  },
  {
    "instruction": "Rate the completeness of this Teach-Out Agreement submission: \"The closing institution submitted the Teach-Out Agreement along with the teach-out institution's enrollment agreement and catalog, but did not include a copy of the teach-out institution's state license.\"",
    "response": "This Teach-Out Agreement submission is incomplete and therefore non-compliant with Policy IV.05. According to Checklist Item 6, the institution must submit to NACCAS with each Teach-Out Agreement: \"a. A copy of the Teach-Out Institution's enrollment agreement. b. A copy of the Teach-Out Institution's catalog. c. A copy of the Teach-Out institution's license issued by the state regulatory agency.\" While the submission includes items 6(a) and 6(b), it fails to include the required state license documentation (6c). All three documents must be submitted for the Teach-Out Agreement to be complete and compliant."
  },
  {
    "instruction": "Explain why this situation requires a new Teach-Out Plan submission: \"An institution submitted a Teach-Out Plan with its Annual Report in January 2025. In March 2025, the institution was placed on probation by its accreditor for financial stability issues.\"",
    "response": "This situation requires a new Teach-Out Plan submission because being placed on probation for financial stability issues constitutes a \"Teach-Out Event\" under Policy IV.05. Section C states that \"In the event of a Teach-Out Event other than a planned Closure of an Institution or program, the Teach-Out Plan (including a draft Teach-Out Agreement, if practicable) must be submitted for approval no later than 15 days following the occurrence of a Teach-Out Event.\" Being placed on probation by an accreditor, particularly for financial stability issues, qualifies as a Teach-Out Event that could potentially impact the institution's ability to serve students, thus triggering the requirement for a new submission within 15 days."
